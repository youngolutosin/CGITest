#### CGITest

There is a folder called URLLIST and in this folder there is text file (urllist). This text file can be populated to take several 
url(s).

The script asks for user's input for regular expression wanted and prints the result of the content matched to console. After the end
of the search, the results are saved in a dictionary for further analysis. 

This dictionary can be further converted into a dataframe and to any file format (.csv or excel etc)

```
To run the script, the user must specify the full path of the system where the urllist is located.

Script execution:

python CGiTest.py

```
